### Image segmentation using Python's cv2 module in the OpenCV library. 

With the help of color masks, OpenCV allows image detection and segmentation. In this project, the fish nemo is segmented from the input image in three steps.
1. Identifying the orange color range in the image- mask1
2. Identifying the white color range in the image- mask2
3. Combining these masks to overlay on the image using bitwise AND.

These two masks are combined to separate the entire fish from its surroundings. 
The entire process involves multiple color conversions- from BGR to RGB for input reading, from RGB to HSV for creating masks, HSV to RGB for plots (matplotlib works with RGB).
